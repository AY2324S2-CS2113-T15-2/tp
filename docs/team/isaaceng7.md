## Overview
BudgetBuddy is a desktop financial tracker application that helps users to manage their personal
finances. It allows users to track their income and expenses across multiple accounts and provides
insights into their financial activities. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
and is written in Java, and has about 3 kLoC.
